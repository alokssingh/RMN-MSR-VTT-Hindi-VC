# Learning to Discretely Compose Reasoning Module Networks for Video Captioning (IJCAI2020)
## Introduction
This code is the Pytorch implementation of RNM is forked from [tgc1997](https://github.com/tgc1997/RMN) and the data Hindi MSR-VTT dataset is created by [alokssingh](https://github.com/alokssingh)
## Dependencies
* Python 3.7 (other versions may also work)
* Pytorch 1.1.0 (other versions may also work)
* pickle
* tqdm
* h5py
* matplotlib
* numpy
* tensorboard_logger


Download visual features from [MSR-VTT](https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/26685ac0-ba08-11ea-866f-6fc664dfaa3b) and text features from [MSR-VTT-Hindi-text](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E4a5u2sge7JVkKnEu_28DHMsBVL8w6MO?usp=sharing) and put them in `data` folder.
